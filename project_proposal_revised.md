#### SER494: Project Proposal
#### Title: Global Trends in Renewable Energy Adoption
#### Author: Anonymous
#### Date: October 28th, 2024

**Keywords:** Clean energy, sustainability, environmental performance

**Description:** This project aims to investigate the factors influencing renewable energy adoption across various
countries. The study will focus on examining how variables such as renewable energy participation in total energy 
production, public investment, and installed per capita renewable energy capacity interact with environmental 
performance. The type of data to be analyzed includes annual renewable energy production, total annual energy production,
annual public flows to renewable, and EPI (Energy Performance Index) results for more than 200 countries.<br>

**Research questions**:
```  
- RO1: To describe trends within renewable energy production among countries utilizing 20-year averages. 

- RO2: To predict the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) score of countries using their Renewable Energy 
Installed Capacity per Capita (20-year averages).

- RO3: To defend the model for performing the prediction in RO2.

- RO4: To evaluate causal relationships implied by the RO2 model, such as the influence of renewable energies on
carbon emissions.
```

**Intellectual Merit:** The project has the potential to uncover insights about how different countries are
performing in renewable energy adoption and whether specific actions are necessary based on these findings.
It will also detect irregularities and country-specific situations that may contradict expected relationships, and
offer a deeper understanding about what accelerates renewable energy adoption.

**Data Sourcing:** The methodology for retrieving relevant data is described as such:

```  
1 Defining data requirements.

2 Selecting data sources.

3 Accessing publicly available data sets or databases.

4 Verifying data integrity and formatting.

5 Maintaining detailed documentation and identifying relevant restrictions.
```

Possible sources of data include:

```  
- International Energy Agency (IEA): For global energy consumption, production data, and energy investment trends.

- International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA): For finance flows and policy data.
 
- Inter-American Development Bank (IADB): For per-capita end-user consumption.

- World Bank Group: For global development statistics.
```
