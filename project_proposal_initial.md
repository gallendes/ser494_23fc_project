#### SER494: Project Proposal
#### Title: Analyzing Global Trends in Renewable Energy Adoption
#### Author: Anonymous
#### Date: September 8th, 2024

**Keywords:** Clean energy growth, sustainability, energy policies

**Description:** This project aims to investigate the factors influencing renewable energy adoption across various
countries. The study will focus on examining how variables such as economic status, government policies, energy demand,
public investment, and environmental performances interact with renewable energy participation in total energy
production. The type of data to be analyzed includes total energy production, production from solar, wind,
hydroelectric, and geothermal sources, economic indicators, national policy metrics (e.g., tax incentives and targets)
per-capita energy consumption figures, public investment amounts, and EPI (Energy Performance Index) results.<br><br>

Some of the key research questions that may be explored include:

```  
- Which countries have the highest per capita energy demand and lowest EPI scores?

- How do government subsidies affect the rate at which renewable energy is being adopted?

- Are government targets aligned with EPI expectations?

- Which end-use industry sector generally has the highest percentage of renewable energy as their energy source?

- How does that measurement vary by country? 
```

**Intellectual Merit:** The project has the potential to uncover insights about how different countries are
performing in renewable energy adoption and whether specific actions are necessary based on these findings.
It will also detect irregularities and country-specific situations that may contradict expected relationships, and
offer a deeper understanding about what accelerates renewable energy adoption.

**Data Sourcing:** The methodology for retrieving relevant data is described as such:

```  
1 Defining data requirements.

2 Selecting data sources.

3 Accessing publicly available data sets or databases.

4 Verifying data integrity and formatting.

5 Maintaining detailed documentation and identifying relevant restrictions.
```

Possible sources of data include:

```  
- International Energy Agency (IEA): For global energy consumption, production data, and energy investment trends.

- International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA): For finance flows and policy data.
 
- Inter-American Development Bank (IADB): For per-capita end-user consumption.

- World Bank Group: For global development statistics.
```
