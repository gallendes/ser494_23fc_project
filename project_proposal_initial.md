#### SER494: Project Proposal
#### Title: Analyzing Global Trends in Renewable Energy Adoption
#### Author: Anonymous
#### Date: September 8th, 2024

**Keywords:** Clean energy growth, sustainability, energy policies

**Description:** This project seeks to investigate the factors impacting renewable energy adoption in different
countries around the world. The study will focus on examining how variables such as economic status, government
policies, energy demand, public investment, and environmental performances interplay with energy participation figures
in total energy production. The type of data to be analyzed includes total production, production from solar, wind,
hydroelectric, and geothermal sources, economic indicators, quantification of national policies such as total tax
deductions for renewable energies and renewable energy targets, per-capita energy consumption figures, public
investment amounts, and EPI (Energy Performance Index) results.<br><br>
Some of the questions that may be selected to investigate relationships are illustrated in the following outline:

```  
- Which countries have the highest per capita energy demand and lowest EPI scores?

- How do government subsidies affect the rate at which renewable energy is being adopted?

- Are government targets aligned with EPI expectations?

- Which end-use industry sector generally has the highest percentage of renewable energy as its source of energy?

- How does the previous measurement vary by country? 
```

**Intellectual Merit:** The project has the potential to discover measurements about how different countries are
performing and determining whether they need to act upon these discovered insights. It will also detect irregularities
and country-specific situations when finding contradictions in expected relationships. It may also discover key drivers
that tend to accelerate the pace of renewable energy adoption.

**Data Sourcing:** The methodology for retrieving relevant data is described as such:

```  
1 Defining data requirements.

2 Selecting a data source.

3 Accessing publicly available free data sets or databases.

4 Verifying data integrity and applying formatting.

5 Keeping detailed documentation and relevant restrictions.
```

Data may be collected from the following non-exclusive list of sources:

```  
- International Energy Agency (IEA): For global energy consumption, production data, and energy investment trends.

- International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA): For finance flows and policy data.
 
- Inter-American Development Bank (IADB): For per-capita end-user consumption.

- World Bank Group: For global development data.
```
